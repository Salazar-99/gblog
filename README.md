This is the source code for my personal website and blog at [gerardosalazar.com](https://gerardosalazar.com).

It's a Next.js app with `shadcn` components and MDX for content.

It's currently deployed on [my single-node kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/Salazar-99/gnode) and has CI/CD configured via GitHub Actions and Azure Container Registry (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`).

## Development

Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
